欢迎来到宋元和的个人网站。我是一个凝聚态物理专业的在读博士生。目前我的研究方向是利用角分辨光电子能谱（ARPES）研究一些非常规超导材料的电子结构。我的主要课题是铁硒薄膜-氧化物界面体系的生长与测量。

Welcome to Yuanhe SONG's personal website. I am a current PhD student majoring in condensed matter physics. Currently my research intersest is studying the electronic structure of some unconventional superconductors by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). My main project is the growth and measurment of FeSe film - Oxide(s) system.
